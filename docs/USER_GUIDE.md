## What is the Guild Chronicle?

*Ah, you wish to know of the Chronicle's nature? Sit, and I shall enlighten you...*

The **Guild Chronicle** is no ordinary Discord bot. It is a sentient magical construct—a weaving of arcane Discord energies and the ancient Google Sheets of Power—bound to preserve every hero's tale for generations yet unborn.

### The Chronicle's Three Sacred Duties

**1. 📜 Preservation of Legends**

When you invoke the `/register_character` incantation, you embark upon a **mystical 12-step journey** through the halls of knowledge. Step by step, the Chronicle guides you—recording your character's name, bloodline, calling, crafts, personality, and deeds. Upon completion, your legend is inscribed in the **Character Sheet Vault**, shimmering with class-specific colors and adorned with your chosen portrait.

**2. ⚖️ The Judgment of Officers**

Characters submitted through the sacred Incantation enter a state of PENDING, awaiting the judgment of our officers—the Pathfinders and Trailwardens. Through the Chronicle's mystical webhooks (instantaneous arcane messages), officers review each submission and decree: ✅ Welcome to the guild, or ❌ The path is not yet ready.

**3. ⚰️ The Rite of Remembrance**

When a hero's tale reaches its inevitable end—whether through glorious sacrifice or tragic fall—officers invoke the **interactive burial ceremony**. Through 6 solemn steps, they record the circumstances of death, compose eulogies, and move the hero's sheet to the **Cemetery**, where they rest in honor alongside all fallen champions.

### Why Should You Care?

Because YOUR character will be **immortalized** in both Discord AND the Google Sheets of Power!

- **Your backstory** will be read by future guild members
- **Your personality** will be referenced in roleplay
- **Your quotes** will echo through Ironforge's halls
- **Your deeds** will inspire legends

Plus, those class-colored embeds with Unicode-styled names? *Chef's kiss* 👌

---

## Your First Steps: Joining the Guild

*Before you can inscribe your legend, you must first earn a title within our order...*

### Required Guild Titles (Roles)

To register a character, you must hold one of these sacred titles:

- 🌟 **Wanderer** - New souls who have just begun their journey
- 🗺️ **Seeker** - Explorers who have proven their dedication
- 🧭 **Pathfinder** - Veteran guides who lead expeditions
- 🛡️ **Trailwarden** - Elite guardians of the guild's sacred paths

**Don't have a title?** The Chronicle will gently inform you: *"Only guild members may inscribe their tales in the archives."* Speak to a guild officer to receive your Wanderer title and begin your journey!

### What You Must Prepare

Before invoking the registration ritual, gather these components:

1. **Your Character's Full Name** - As it appears in World of Warcraft
2. **Your Character's Race** - From 11 defined bloodlines (see list below)
3. **Your Character's Class** - Must be one of the 9 Classic WoW classes
4. **Your Character's Roles** - Select 1 or more (Tank, Healer, DPS, Support)
5. **Your Character's Professions** - Optional, but enhances your legend
6. **A Portrait Image** - Your character's visage (URL required) (Optional)
7. **An Epic Backstory** - Where they came from, what shaped them (Mandatory, max 1024 characters)
8. **Personality Traits** - What defines your hero's visible nature (Optional, max 1024 characters)
9. **Memorable Quotes** - Up to 3 iconic lines (optional but recommended)

This will not only serve us at crafting a Character Sheet for you but also is compatible with TTRP addon,
which permitts in-game viewing of other players character sheets and showing them your own.

### The Portrait Mystery: Obtaining Your Character's Visage

*Ah yes, the portrait—the trickiest component! Fear not, for I shall guide you...*

**Method 1: Upload to Discord, Copy Link**
1. Go to any Discord channel where you can post messages (even a DM to yourself works!)
2. Upload your portrait image (drag & drop or click the + button)
3. Once uploaded, right-click the image → **Copy Link**
4. Paste this URL during the registration flow

**Method 2: Use Imgur (Free Image Hosting)**
1. Visit [imgur.com](https://imgur.com)
2. Click "New post" and upload your image
3. After upload, right-click image → **Copy image address**
4. Use this URL in registration

**Method 3: Request Default Placeholder**
- During Step 11 (The Visage), you can select "Use default placeholder"
- The Chronicle will use a mystical fallback image
- You can update it later!

**Method 4: Request AI Generation (Phase 2 Feature)**
- Coming soon! You'll be able to request an AI-generated portrait
- Officers will generate it using Stable Diffusion XL
- The Chronicle will flag your submission with `request_sdxl=TRUE`

**⚠️ Critical: The URL must start with `http://` or `https://`**

Invalid examples:

## The Sacred Ritual: Registering Your Legend

*Now, Champion, the moment has arrived. Let us perform the sacred incantation...*

### Step Zero: Invoking the Command

In any channel where the Guild Chronicle listens, type:

```
/register_character
```

**THAT'S IT.** No complicated parameters! No confusing forms! The Chronicle will guide you through every step.

Discord will show you a simple slash command with NO FIELDS. Just press Enter.

## The Interactive Journey (12 Mystical Steps)

*The tome materializes before you, its pages shimmering with arcane energy...*

### Step 1: The Introduction

```
🏛️ *A massive tome materializes before you, its pages shimmering
   with arcane energy. An elderly dwarf with a magnificent beard
   looks up from his writing desk.*

   Greetings, brave soul! I am Chronicler Thaldrin, Keeper of
   Knowledge from the Grand Library of Ironforge.

   You seek to inscribe your legend into our eternal archives?
   Splendid! *adjusts spectacles*

   But first—a formality of the modern age. May I record your
   Discord identity for our records? We'll use this to contact
   you about your character's fate.

   Your Discord ID: @YourUsername#1234

   [Button: ✅ Yes, record my identity]
   [Button: ❌ No, I wish to remain anonymous]

   *(Note: Choosing 'No' will use a generic ID, but you won't
   receive DM notifications)*
```

**What happens:**
- If you choose ✅: Your Discord ID is recorded (recommended!)
- If you choose ❌: The Chronicle proceeds but won't DM you updates

---

### Step 2: The Name

```
*The tome's pages flip open with a whisper of ancient parchment.
 Golden ink begins to pool on the blank page, awaiting your words.*

📜 **CHAPTER ONE: THE NAME**

Every legend begins with a name. A name spoken in taverns,
whispered in battle, carved upon monuments.

**What shall the bards call your hero?**

*(Type your character's full name - 1 to 100 characters)*
```

**You type:** `Thorgar Ironforge`

```
*The quill dances across the parchment, etching 'THORGAR IRONFORGE'
 in bold runes that glow briefly before settling into the page.*

A strong name! Forged in mountain halls, no doubt. *nods approvingly*
```

**Validation:** Must be 1-100 characters

---

### Step 3: The Bloodline

```
⚔️ **CHAPTER TWO: THE BLOODLINE**

From which people dost thou hail, Thorgar? The blood of your
ancestors flows through your veins—whose legacy do you carry?

**Choose your heritage:**
```

**[Dropdown menu with emojis and descriptions:]**

```
🦁 Human          (Stormwind's versatile champions)
⛰️ Dwarf          (Ironforge's stout-hearted warriors)
🌙 Night Elf      (Kalimdor's ancient guardians)
⚙️ Gnome          (Gnomeregan's ingenious tinkers)
✨ High Elf       (Quel'Thalas's noble descendants)
─────────────────
🔥 Orc            (Durotar's honorable warriors)
💀 Undead         (Forsaken souls of free will)
🐂 Tauren         (Thunder Bluff's noble nomads)
🗿 Troll          (Darkspear's cunning survivors)
💰 Goblin         (Horde-joined shrewd merchants)
─────────────────
❓ Other          (Unique or mixed heritage)
```

**You select:** `Dwarf`

```
*The chronicler's eyes light up*

Ahh, a kinsman! The mountains sing with pride! ⛰️

*He adjusts his beard with obvious satisfaction*
```

**Note:** The Chronicler responds differently based on your choice! If you pick Night Elf, he'll comment on the elegance of Teldrassil. If you pick Undead, he'll express solemn respect for your resilience.

---

### Step 4: The Calling

```
🔮 **CHAPTER THREE: THE CALLING**

What path has fate woven for thee, Thorgar Ironforge? What arts
do you practice, what powers do you wield?

**Choose your class:**
```

```

**You select:** `Warrior`

```
⚔️ *The tome records your choice with a crimson flourish*

A WARRIOR! Aye, I can see it in your bearing. Steel and fury!

*The chronicler thumps his fist approvingly on the desk*
```

---

### Step 5: The Roles

```
🎭 **CHAPTER FOUR: THE MANY MASKS**

Ah, but warriors are not so simple, are they? *winks*
A hero may wear many mantles upon the battlefield.

Tell me, what roles do you fulfill when battle calls?

**Select ALL that apply (minimum 1):**
```

**[Multi-select checkboxes:]**

[Button: Continue with selected roles]
```

**You check:** `Tank` and `Melee DPS`

```

TANK and MELEE DPS! A frontline champion who protects AND
punishes! The perfect dwarf! *strokes beard proudly*
```

**Validation:**

- Can select multiple
- The Chronicle comments based on versatility (3+ roles = "A versatile champion!")

---

### Step 6: The Crafts

```
🔨 **CHAPTER FIVE: THE CRAFTS** *(Optional)*

Do you practice any trades, Thorgar? Mining ore from the deep
places? Forging weapons? Weaving enchantments?

**Select your professions** (optional - you may skip this):
```

**[Multi-select with checkboxes:]**

```
□ ⚗️ Alchemy        □ 🔨 Blacksmithing    □ ✨ Enchanting

[Button: Continue (with selected professions)]
[Button: Skip (I practice no trades)]
```

**You select:** `Mining` and `Blacksmithing`

```
⛏️🔨 *The tome inscribes your crafts with respect*

Mining and Blacksmithing! Of COURSE! What self-respecting
dwarf doesn't know their way around an anvil? *chuckles*
```

**Validation:**
- Optional (can skip entirely)
- Maximum 2 main professions + 4 secondary (standard WoW rules)
- If you select 7+ professions, the Chronicler will express doubt and ask you to reconsider

**Chronicle's Comments:**
- 1-2 professions: "A focused craftsman!"
- 3-4 professions: "A versatile artisan!"
- 5-6 professions: "Ambitious! You seek to master many trades?"
- 7+: "Hold, friend. Even the mightiest heroes can only master 2 main professions and 4 secondary. Please reconsider."

---

### Step 7: The Three Traits

```
⚡ **CHAPTER SIX: THE THREE TRAITS**

Now we reach the essence, Thorgar. Every hero can be known by
three traits—three words that define them when all else is
stripped away.

These are not hidden personality quirks. These are the traits
OTHERS SEE when they look upon you. What your enemies fear.
What your allies depend upon.

**Inscribe three traits that define your hero's outer nature:**

Examples: Brave, Cunning, Loyal, Stubborn, Hot-headed, Wise,
Reckless, Kind, Cruel, Humble, Arrogant, Cautious...
```

**[Three input fields:]**

```
[Input field: Trait 1] (required)
[Input field: Trait 2] (required)
[Input field: Trait 3] (required)

[Button: Continue]
```

**You enter:** `Brave`, `Loyal`, `Stubborn`

```
*Three runes blaze into existence above your name*

⚡ BRAVE • LOYAL • STUBBORN ⚡

Perfect! These are the pillars upon which your legend rests.
Others will see these qualities in you, for better or worse!

*The chronicler nods approvingly*
```

**Validation:** All 3 traits required (1-50 chars each)

---

### Step 8: The Tale

```
📖 **CHAPTER SEVEN: THE TALE**

*The tome's pages multiply, making room for your story*

Here's where legends truly begin, Thorgar. Tell me your
backstory—where you came from, what shaped you, what drives
you forward.

This is your moment to shine! Be creative! Be epic!

**Write your character's backstory:**
*(Maximum 1024 characters - about 3-4 good paragraphs)*
```

**[Large text area field]**

**You write:**

```
Born in the depths of Ironforge, Thorgar learned the ways of
the hammer from his father, a legendary weaponsmith. When the
call to arms echoed through the mountain halls, he took up his
father's warhammer and vowed to defend Azeroth from all threats.

He has fought orcs in the Burning Steppes, undead in the
Plaguelands, and even dragons in the peaks of Blackrock. But
his greatest battle is yet to come...
```

```
*The quill flies across pages, recording every word*

Magnificent! *wipes away a proud tear*

The bards will sing of this! I can already hear the verses...

*He begins humming an epic tune before catching himself*
```

**Validation:** Required, maximum 1024 characters

---

### Step 9: The Soul (Optional)

```
💭 **CHAPTER EIGHT: THE INNER SOUL** *(Optional)*

If you wish, you may also describe your character's personality—
their inner thoughts, how they think, what makes them tick.

This is separate from your visible traits. This is the INNER you.

**Describe your personality** (optional):
*(Maximum 1024 characters)*

[Text area]

[Button: Continue]
[Button: Skip (no personality description)]
```

**You write:**

```
Beneath the gruff exterior lies a heart of gold. Thorgar values
honor above all else and would rather die than break an oath.
He's slow to anger but terrifying once provoked. In quiet moments,
he's surprisingly philosophical, often quoting his father's wisdom.
```

```
*The tome glows warmly as it absorbs your words*

Ah, depth of character! This is what separates heroes from
mere adventurers. Well done!
```

**Validation:** Optional, maximum 1024 characters

---

### Step 10: The Words (Optional)

```
💬 **CHAPTER NINE: THE WORDS** *(Optional)*

Does your character have any memorable quotes? Battle cries?
Catchphrases? Words they live by?

Share up to 3 iconic quotes:
*(Maximum 1024 characters total)*

[Text area]

[Button: Continue]
[Button: Skip (no quotes)]
```

**You write:**

```
For Khaz Modan!|No dwarf left behind.|My hammer speaks for me.
```

*(Use pipes `|` or newlines to separate quotes)*

```
*The tome inscribes your words in shimmering silver*

💬 "For Khaz Modan!"
💬 "No dwarf left behind."
💬 "My hammer speaks for me."

THESE are the words that shall echo through eternity! Brilliant!
```

**Validation:** Optional, maximum 1024 characters total, split into max 3 quotes

---

### Step 11: The Visage

## Understanding the Fates: Character States

*Let me explain the three fates that may befall your character...*

### 1. PENDING → The Waiting Period

**What it means:** Your character has been inscribed and is awaiting judgment by the officers.

**Where you are:**

- ✅ and ❌ reaction options

**Next steps:**

---

### 2. REGISTERED → Active Hero

**What it means:** Your character has been approved! Welcome to Azeroth Bound!

**How you got here:** An officer reacted ✅ on your recruitment post

**Where you are:**
- 🏛️ **Character Sheet Vault** - Your own forum thread with your character sheet
- 📊 Google Sheets with `status=REGISTERED`
- 🎉 Officially part of the guild roster

**What you can do:**

**Your sheet includes:**

---

### 3. REJECTED → The Path Not Taken

**What it means:** An officer determined your submission wasn't ready.

**How you got here:** An officer reacted ❌ on your recruitment post

**What happens:**
- 📭 You receive a DM: *"Your character submission has been reviewed and unfortunately was not approved. Please contact a guild officer for more information."*
- 📊 Google Sheets updates to `status=REJECTED`
- 📝 Officer's Discord ID recorded in `reviewed_by`

**What to do:**
- Contact the officer who reviewed your submission (ID provided)
- Ask for feedback on how to improve
- Make changes and resubmit (start `/register_character` again)

**Common rejection reasons:**
- Backstory too short or generic
- Portrait inappropriate or low quality
- Lore-breaking elements (e.g., "I'm from the year 2025")
- Personality not thoughtful or clearly trolling

---

### 4. DECEASED → Awaiting Burial

**What it means:** An officer has marked your character as deceased using `/bury`, and the burial ceremony is about to begin.

**How you got here:** Your character died in-game or roleplay

**What happens:**
- 📊 Google Sheets updates to `status=DECEASED`
- 🔔 Webhook fires instantly

**This is automatic** - officers just set status to DECEASED, the rest happens instantly via webhooks!

---

### 5. BURIED → Eternal Rest

**What it means:** Your character has been laid to rest in the Cemetery.

**Where you are:**
- ⚰️ **Cemetery Forum** - A somber, respectful memorial thread
- 📊 Google Sheets with `status=BURIED`
- 🕊️ No longer active, but NEVER forgotten

**Your memorial includes:**
- 🪦 Ceremonial embed with tombstone emoji
- 📜 Original character sheet (preserved forever)
- 📖 Death story / eulogy (if officer provided one)
- 💬 Comments from guild members paying respects

**Can you be resurrected?**

Technically yes, but only through:
- Officer manually changing status in Google Sheets
- Lore-appropriate resurrection event
- Guild leadership approval

In practice, death should be permanent and meaningful. Speak to officers if you have a compelling IC reason for resurrection.

---

## When Heroes Fall: The Cemetery

*The most solemn duty of the Chronicler is recording the fall of heroes...*

### What is the Cemetery?

The **Cemetery** is a sacred forum channel where fallen heroes rest in peace. Unlike the vibrant Character Sheet Vault, the Cemetery is quiet, somber, and respectful—a place for remembrance.

### When Do Characters Go There?

When an officer (Pathfinder or Trailwarden) invokes the **interactive burial ceremony** using `/bury`:

1. 🔍 Officer searches for your character
2. ✅ Confirms it's the right character
3. 💀 Enters death cause (e.g., "Fell defending Southshore, level 42")
4. 📖 Optionally writes an IC eulogy/death story
5. ⚰️ Confirms the burial

The bot then **INSTANTLY** (via webhooks):
- Creates cemetery thread with ceremonial embed
- Copies your original character sheet
- Posts the death story
- Notifies you via DM
- Notifies @everyone in cemetery
- Archives your original thread

### What Does a Cemetery Post Look Like?

```
⚰️ THORGAR IRONFORGE

[Ceremonial Embed - Gray Color Scheme]

Here rests Thorgar Ironforge, whose tale has reached its end.

Race: Dwarf • Class: Warrior
Registered: 2025-12-10 • Buried: 2025-12-16

Death Cause: Fell defending Southshore from Horde raid, level 42

May their deeds echo through the ages,
and may the Light embrace them in eternal rest.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Death Story - If Provided]

In the twilight of his 42nd season, Thorgar stood shield to
shield with his brothers in Southshore. When the Horde war
cry echoed across the hills, he did not flee. He raised his
warhammer high and roared "NO DWARF LEFT BEHIND!"

The battle was fierce. One by one, his companions fell. But
Thorgar held the line, allowing innocents to escape. When the
final blow came, he fell with honor, his father's warhammer
still clutched in his hand.

The mountains wept that day. But Khaz Modan remembers.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

```

### Can I Visit the Cemetery?

**Yes!** The Cemetery is a public forum channel. You can:

- Read fallen heroes' stories
- Pay respects in the threads
- Remember your fallen comrades
- Find inspiration for your own character's potential end

It's a beautiful, melancholy place—handled with utmost respect.

## Common Mysteries Solved: Troubleshooting

*Even the mightiest magic encounters gremlins. Here's how to banish them...*

### "I can't see the /register_character command!"

**Possible Causes:**

1. **You don't have a guild role**
   - The command exists, but Discord hides it if you lack permissions
   - **Solution:** Ask an officer for the Wanderer role

2. **The bot is offline**
   - Check if "The Chronicler" (or bot name) appears offline in member list
   - **Solution:** Alert a guild administrator

3. **Slash commands haven't synced**
   - Discord can take up to 1 hour to sync new commands
   - **Solution:** Wait, or ask an admin to restart the bot

---

### "The interactive flow timed out!"

**What happened:** You took longer than 5 minutes (300 seconds) to complete a step.

**Solution:**
- Start over with `/register_character`
- The flow timer resets at each step, so you have 5 minutes PER STEP
- If you need more time, ask an officer to increase `INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`

---

### "I made a typo in my character's name!"

**Can it be fixed?** Yes, but not through the bot.

**Solution:**
1. Contact an officer
2. Officer edits the Google Sheets row directly
3. Changes sync to Discord automatically (via webhooks)

**Future:** Phase 2 will add an `/edit_character` command for self-service edits.

---

### "My portrait isn't showing!"

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Invalid URL**
   - URL doesn't start with `http://` or `https://`
   - URL is a "share link" not a direct image link
   - **Solution:** Re-upload to Imgur or Discord, get direct image URL

2. **Image host blocked**
   - Some image hosts are blocked by Discord
   - **Solution:** Use Imgur.com or Discord CDN (upload to Discord, copy link)

3. **URL broke after submission**
   - Image was deleted from host
   - **Solution:** Contact officer, provide new URL, they'll update sheets

---

### "I got rejected but don't know why!"

   - Generic personality ("nice guy" isn't enough!)
   - Portrait inappropriate

## Tips for Epic Character Sheets

*Listen well, for these are the secrets of legendary inscriptions...*

### 1. Write a COMPELLING Backstory

**Bad backstory:**
> "Bob is a warrior. He likes fighting."

**Good backstory:**
> "Born in Stormwind's orphanage after his parents fell to the Scourge, Marcus learned to fight in the streets. When he came of age, he enlisted in the Stormwind Guard, vowing no child would suffer as he did. Now he wields his blade not for glory, but for protection—the shield between darkness and the innocent."

**Tips:**
- Include WHERE they're from
- Include WHAT shaped them (trauma, mentor, event)
- Include WHY they adventure (motivation)
- Use vivid language ("forged in battle" not "good at fighting")

---

### 2. Make Personality SPECIFIC

**Bad personality:**
> "Nice, friendly, brave"

**Good personality:**
> "Gruff exterior masking deep compassion. Slow to trust but fiercely loyal once earned. Prone to gallows humor in dark moments. Respects strength but admires wisdom more."

**Tips:**
- Avoid generic adjectives
- Include contradictions (makes characters interesting!)
- Think about HOW they act, not just WHAT they are
- Reference their mannerisms

---

### 3. Choose MEMORABLE Quotes

**Bad quotes:**
> "Let's go!" | "Yeah!" | "Cool"

**Good quotes:**
> "My ancestors smile upon me. Can you say the same?" | "Death smiles at us all. All we can do is smile back." | "They will sing songs of this day... or they won't. Either way, I'm thirsty."

**Tips:**
- Make them sound like YOUR character (not generic lines)
- Include battle cries, catchphrases, or philosophical musings
- Reference their backstory or personality
- Use archaic language if appropriate for race/class

---

### 4. Match Portrait to Character

**Bad portrait matching:**
- Playing a scarred veteran → Using art of a clean-faced teenager
- Playing a holy priest → Using art of a demonic warlock

**Good portrait matching:**
- Grizzled dwarf warrior → Portrait with scars, beard, weathered face
- Young night elf priestess → Portrait with elegant features, moonlight aesthetic
- Undead rogue → Portrait emphasizing skeletal features, dark colors

**Where to find portraits:**
- [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com) - Search "fantasy character art"
- [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com) - Tons of character portraits
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) - Search "D&D character portrait"
- Commission an artist! (Support artists!)

### 5. Use the Three Traits Wisely

**Bad traits:**
> "Good" | "Strong" | "Cool"

**Good traits:**
> "Vengeful" | "Methodical" | "Uncompromising"

**Tips:**
- These are EXTERNAL traits—what others SEE
- Make them interesting (flaws are good!)
- They should inform how others interact with your character
- Think: "If someone met my character, what 3 words would they use?"

---

### 6. Proofread Before Finalizing!

**The Preview (Step 12) is your FRIEND!**

Check for:
- ✅ Spelling errors
- ✅ Grammar mistakes
- ✅ Formatting issues (Discord markdown: `**bold**`, `*italic*`)
- ✅ Portrait loading correctly
- ✅ All fields filled as intended

**If something's wrong:** Click 🔄 "No, let me start over"
