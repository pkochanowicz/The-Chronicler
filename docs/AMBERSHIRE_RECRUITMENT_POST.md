🏛️ **AZEROTH BOUND** 🏛️
*Where Legends Are Forged, Recorded, and Remembered*

---

**Greetings, heroes of Ambershire.**

There are threats in this world that transcend faction lines. Challenges that demand we put aside old grudges and unite under a single banner. **Azeroth Bound** is that banner — a sanctuary for those who dare to walk between Horde and Alliance, who seek glory in the face of permanent death, and who believe that every hero's story deserves to be told.

---

## ⚔️ **Who We Are**

We are a **Hardcore Roleplay guild** operating on **Turtle WoW's Ambershire**. We welcome **both Horde and Alliance** heroes who share our values:

🛡️ **Hardcore Commitment** — One life. One story. Make it legendary.
📖 **Roleplay Immersion** — Every interaction is in-character. Every choice matters.
🤝 **Cross-Faction Unity** — We've set aside red and blue to face the true darkness together.
🎭 **Narrative Excellence** — Your backstory isn't just lore—it's your legacy.

## ✨ **What Makes Us Different: The Chronicler**

Other guilds use spreadsheets. We use **magic.**

We've built **The Chronicler** — a custom arcane construct (Discord bot) that transforms guild management into an immersive roleplay experience:

📜 **Interactive Character Registration**
Meet **Chronicler Thaldrin**, a dwarf priest who guides you through a 12-step cinematic ritual. No boring forms. No copy-pasting. Just an immersive conversation where you craft your hero's identity, upload your portrait, and inscribe your backstory into the guild's eternal archives.

⚰️ **The Rite of Remembrance**
When a hero falls in Hardcore, we don't just delete their sheet. Our officers perform a sacred burial ceremony, moving their record to **The Cemetery** — a permanent memorial where fallen champions are honored forever.

🏛️ **Living Character Archive**
Every approved hero gets their own dedicated thread in our **Character Sheet Vault**. Your character isn't just data in a database—they're a permanent part of guild history, complete with their portrait, backstory, roles, and achievements.

🏦 **Guild Bank System** (comming soon)
Track every deposit and withdrawal with transparency. The Chronicler remembers who donated that Linen Cloth stack.

⚔️ **Talent Validation** (comming soon)
Ensures your build follows Classic+ rules. No cheating the talent trees—The Chronicler *knows*.

## 🌍 **Both Factions, One Mission**

We are **Neutral ground**.

- **Horde heroes** stand shoulder-to-shoulder with **Alliance champions**.
- Orcs, Humans, Night Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Tauren—**all races, all classes, united**.
- Our Discord transcends faction borders. Our enemies are bugs, bad builds, and preventable deaths—not each other.

This isn't just tolerance. This is **true unity**.

---

## 💀 **Hardcore or Softcore?**

We are a **Hardcore RP guild**, Every character death is treated with gravity. Every survival is celebrated. Every story matters.

If you're playing HC, your character's life has weight.

---

## 🎯 **What We Offer**

✅ **Structured RP Events** — Guild stories, character arcs, and narrative campaigns
✅ **Officer Support** — Dedicated leadership who review applications and guide new members
✅ **Cross-Faction Coordination** — Shared Discord, shared goals, shared triumphs
✅ **Permanent Legacy** — Your character's story is preserved, win or lose
✅ **Active Community** — Roleplayers who care about lore, immersion, and each other
✅ **Cutting-Edge Tech** — The Chronicler bot is unlike anything you've seen in WoW guilds

## 📝 **Posting Tips**

1. **Add an image/banner** if Ambershire allows attachments (use guild logo or Chronicler art)
2. **Use Discord formatting** — The markdown above should work in Discord
3. **Pin or bump regularly** — Keep your post visible in the recruitment channel
4. **Be responsive** — Answer questions from interested RPers quickly
5. **Mention Turtle WoW** clearly so people know it's not retail/classic era

## 🎨 **Optional: Visual Assets**

If you want to make the post stand out more:
- Screenshot The Chronicler's registration flow
- Show a character sheet from the vault
- Post a cemetery memorial as an example
- Share the guild Discord banner

## 📊 **Response Strategy**

When people respond with interest:
1. **Welcome them warmly** (in RP voice if appropriate)
2. **Direct them to Discord**: https://discord.gg/fJDzq5rfAK
3. **Tell them to use `/register_character`** immediately
4. **Offer to answer questions** about HC/RP/both-factions
5. **Mention officer availability** for approval (don't make them wait days)

## 🚫 **What NOT to Say**

- Don't bash other guilds
- Don't oversell (the bot speaks for itself)
- Don't be elitist about HC (welcome softcore RPers)
- Don't gatekeep RP experience (newbies are welcome)
- Don't metagame faction conflict (stay neutral and welcoming)
